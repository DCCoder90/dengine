# dEngine

dEngine is a simple 2D game engine written in C++ and making use of the SDL library.

This is really just kind of a hobby and nothing amazing is expected to come out of this aside from maybe a simple game or two I write just because.

## Dependencies

* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [zLib](https://www.zlib.net/)

## How do I make a game?!

Take a look at the [dengine Readme](./dengine/ReadMe.md) for details on making the game as well as generating the code documentation.
